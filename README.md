Under heavy development.

A chatbot interaction abstraction.

# TODO
- Make Chatbot.py very clear for anyone who wants to write an implementation
- ensure options like keep_response_in_context are followed by all classes; maybe come up with some mechanism by which options for specific classes are validated; i.e. derived class has valid_options attribute and parent has validate_options method
